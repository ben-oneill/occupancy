Description: This package adds functions to work with various occupancy distributions, including the classical 
    and extended occupancy distributions.  These distributions occur in cases where balls are randomly allocated 
    to bins.  (The manual contains more information on the specific distributions and the situations in which 
    they arise.)  Using syntax analogous to the distributions in base R, the package allows the user to obtain 
    the PDF, CDF, quantile function, and generation of random variables.  There are also functions to calculate 
    the first four central moments of the distributions.
